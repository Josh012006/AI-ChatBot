## Presentation
It's just a very simple chatbot written in Python with the help of Groq and llama3.

## Don't forget
You will need an API key from the Groq website. So don't forget to get one and put it in the **api_key** field at the top of the code.

## How to run it
Just run the python file from your terminal with:
**python main.py**

There it is. Have fun!
